# METAorder

## Overview

METAorder is an internal order management system designed to streamline the processing and tracking of e-commerce orders originating from Shopware. Its primary purpose is to provide a centralized, efficient interface for employees and administrators to manage orders, update shipping information, handle document numbers, and monitor order statuses. The system aims to enhance operational efficiency through an information-dense, Material Design-inspired UI, capable of handling data-heavy workflows and supporting multi-language operations. Key capabilities include comprehensive order viewing, detailed product information display, management of cross-selling (both manual and automated), robust user and role management with granular permissions, and full internationalization support.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a **React SPA** developed with **TypeScript** and **Vite**. It employs **Tailwind CSS** with **shadcn/ui** for a Material Design-inspired interface, **Wouter** for routing, and **TanStack Query** for server state management. Form handling is facilitated by **React Hook Form** with **Zod** validation. The application supports internationalization via **i18next** (German as default, English, Spanish) and uses Euro (â‚¬) as the primary currency.

### Backend Architecture

The backend is a **REST API** built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **TypeScript**. It features JWT-based authentication for session management and utilizes a storage abstraction layer (`IStorage`) that supports swappable data persistence, currently implemented with **PostgreSQL** via Drizzle ORM. The backend serves both API endpoints and the built frontend assets.

### Database Design

The system uses **PostgreSQL** with **Drizzle ORM** for schema definition and **Drizzle Kit** for migrations. The schema includes tables for Users, Roles, Settings, and Cross-Selling Rules, with JSONB fields for flexible data storage.

### Authentication & Authorization

The system implements **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with granular, permission-based authorization. Authentication is **JWT-based**, with tokens issued upon login and validated for all protected routes, ensuring secure access and addressing third-party cookie restrictions. User passwords are hashed using bcryptjs.

### Design Patterns

Key architectural patterns include the **Repository Pattern** for data storage abstraction, an **API Client Pattern** for centralized request handling, **Component Composition** for UI development, and **Schema-driven validation** with Zod.

### UI/UX Decisions

The UI adheres to **Material Design principles** and **Roboto typography**, prioritizing information density. Features include pagination, sorting, sales channel filtering, multi-document support, ERP document number display, server-side product search, and responsive product cards. Cross-selling management offers CRUD operations and a rule engine for automated suggestions. The UI integrates interactive **DatePicker** components for improved date selection.

Displays order/payment status distribution, product overview, category sales, best/worst sellers, and sales trends.
-   **Internationalization**: Full i18n support across the application for order statuses, filter panels, analytics, and general UI elements in German, English, and Spanish.
